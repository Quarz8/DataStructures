# DataStructures
Collection of my C++ Data Structures Work  

Labs are generally code that was given, and I had to figure out what it did and comment it. Occasionally I also had to code a timer around the given code so that runtimes could be observed in the console.  
Assignments are generally my solution to a coding task given by the professor.
